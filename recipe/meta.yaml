  summary: NCurses Disk Usage
  description: |
    Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It is designed to
    find space hogs on a remote server where you don't have an entire graphical
    setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems.
    Ncdu aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, and should be able to run
    in any minimal POSIX-like environment with ncurses installed.
